# MirrorServiceTest
Solution of a middle unity developer test task.
My implementation of the service approach to the game architecture with Mirror Networking.

The task was to create a multiplayer game, with 3rd person controls. In that game you need to touch another player character using dash ability. 
When a player is hit, his character changes color for 3 seconds and becomes invulnerable. The player who successfully hit another player gets a point.
The first player who scored 3 points wins, then, after 5 seconds match is restarted. The score of each player must be displayed.

The use of assets containing C# code other than Mirror Networking is not allowed.
